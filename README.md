# VLR-momentum-finder

## Introduction ##

This code came out of a school project, where I needed some data to do some kind of mathematical analysis.

I'd been very interested in the idea of momentum, and I love VALORANT, so here it is.

A lot of the code is AI-written. The comments are all AI-generated.

## How to use it ##

Uhh idk how to use code ig just copy and paste it in a Python compiler?
You need the vlr team number, it should show in the URL. You also need the number of matches you want to analyze.

## Limitations ##

As of now you can only parse matches starting from the most recent one.
Also it doesn't work if the match history of the team has the team under a different name...

## Thank you! ##
